pulls from inventory.txt to show ouput:
"[user's inventory] item1 x99, item2 x01"

username 24 // this user has pulled 24 times w/o a 5 star

when you pull a 5 star, it sets back to 0. 
check this file before rolling to guarantee 5 star on 25th pull,
so if guarantee = 24, then guarantee a 5 star.
roll btwn the 5 stars available for user.

[[run script to check time, reset all pulls to 0 for each line at 00:00 UTC]]

One gacha pull is 10 akaiyen for example. 
so your first 10 pulls are in the 100 akaiyen threshold...
(before rates climb higher)

we could even use this so that y

=== .gacha ===

roll perhaps on a 1000 sided dice
950 and up is a 5 star for ex
800 and up is a 4 star for ex

if lets say a 5 star is selected,
lets say there is 10 total 5 stars, then roll a 10d
and if you get 1, you get the 5 star corresponding to 1

more work on this later...
