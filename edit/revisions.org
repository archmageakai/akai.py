Revisions to gacha:

1) Blades can be pulled multiple times. QTYs will be output as powerOf/Exponentials, i think i'll have 5 stars move up quicker than 4 stars. No limit to gettings duplicate blades. If you pull a blade send time it outputs Blade name (2) if 2nd time

2) Blade cores: 4 star blades give you 3 cores. 5 star blades give you 7 cores.

3) Weapon types don't matter yet. maybe don't let them.

4) Blade Skills (unique abilities, use skills to dish out high dmg(atk), use buffs, heal

5) each blade basically just ups your stats, gives you new skill to use. instead of a "party"

6) Atk/Def/HP/EP

7) options: Atk, Defend, Blade Skill, Item

8) output:
   line 1: you move / they move (damage here)
   line 2: HP: xxxx EP: xxxx | Atk / Def / Skl / Itm

9) demon lord behavior 

10) blade skills will be heals, buffs, skills that use items like cola exploder, all of them use EP, all skills will set your element, and then Atk or Guard has a chance to PASS THAT ELEMENT
